The capacity of a link in an IAB network degrades with increasing IAB-node density. But IAB network with controlled transmit power gives better performance than the  network  without  controlled  transmit power  in  terms  of  capacity.  In  our  result ,  when  the node density is 3/km^2, the network with controlled transmit power has  a  capacity 1.216 bps/Hz  and  the  network  without controlled transmit power shows a capacity of 0.5481 bps/Hz. So,  for  a  particular  link,  the  IAB  network  with  controlled transmits  power  holds  a  capacity 0.6679 bps/Hz  higher  than the IAB network without controlled transmit power.
